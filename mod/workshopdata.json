  "Title": "The Unbound Slugcat",
  "Description": "A slugcat originally uploaded for 1.9.06 and released for it, updated.\r\nHe can chain walljumps, double jump by pressing the jump key, and has a semi-variable long jump.\r\nNote that his colours may not work properly when using Jolly Co-op to change his colours.\r\n\r\nI am not taking criticism; I made this for fun. Thank you.",
