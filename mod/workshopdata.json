  "Title": "The Unbound Slugcat",
  "Description": "\u0022I was never supposed to be here.\u0022\r\nA slugcat with Cyan-lizard-like abilities and a unique overseer friend struggles to survive in a world already built to take down someone like him.\r\nJump a second time in the air... and a third time after long-jumping!\r\n\r\n[url=https://discord.gg/EmPJh7s2dY]My modding server[/url]. Please consider joining if you enjoy what I make.\r\n\r\nA custom slugcat originally uploaded for 1.9.06 and released for it, updated.\r\nTimeline-wise, Unbound is set between Artificer and Hunter post-Moon collapse. Some rooms have been fully level edited to reflect this.\r\nDownpour is not necessary, but is heavily recommended to fully enjoy exploring.\r\nNo ending (yet), changes to Iterator dialogue, much of which will be changed in a future update.\r\n\r\nI am not taking criticism; I made this for fun. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]Compatibilities[/h1]\r\nFake Achievements- planned\r\nPush to Meow- planned\r\n\r\n[h1]Incompatibilities and Dependencies[/h1]\r\nNo known incompatibilities. If you find one, please let me know- I wish to make this mod as compatible as possible!\r\nSlugbase is the only dependency, world files and item information was edited and coded in by hand.\r\n\r\n[h1]Links[/h1]\r\nGithub: https://github.com/neoncityrain/NCRUnbound\r\nWiki: https://rainworldmods.miraheze.org/wiki/Unbound\r\nArtfight profile: https://artfight.net/character/4449687.the-unbound\r\n\r\n[h1]Credits[/h1]\r\n[b]Ice Fox of Camelot / Pix:[/b] music\r\n[b]Agriocnemis / Ymir:[/b] helping code, keeping me from spontaneously combusting over math, and quality testing dialogue\r\n[b]Pink:[/b] Design, reference, and optional included dress my slugcat skin\r\nSpecial thanks also goes to [b]Scuglat[/b], who encouraged me to revisit this mod.\r\n\r\n[img]https://64.media.tumblr.com/832e7c268608a3eb3485dcfa160016fe/54c107dad43f1e23-16/s640x960/32b1bd5cc88c3a60ab840c360d0b96ff20b95a68.png[/img]",
