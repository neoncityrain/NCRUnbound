FP: Oh, this is a small plate of spiritual guidance. From an age long before the Void Fluid revolution.

FP: The text is typical for its era, and details how to shed oneself of the fourth natural urge of life, gluttony.

FP: I cannot imagine you are familiar with the literature, but all living things have an understanding<LINE>of the five natural urges. Even if that understanding is only a subconscious one.

FP: For example, you are bound by the first urge. Your mind is fixated. Striving towards a single goal. One<LINE>from which you are unable to turn away from. Because of this, you are trapped, just the same as I am.

FP: While your chains are made of your own natural urges, mine are a duty to my creators. My kind are built<LINE>unable to ascend, as our minds are not our own. Composed of microbial life, machinery, and electronics.

FP: Of course, that holds true only in theory... it is, arguable that a member of my kind has done so. That<LINE>perhaps, it is not merely shedding one's natural urges, but to shed the perception of reality itself.

FP: In any case, thank you. I have a fondness for artifacts such as this. They remind me of better times.
