FP: This is a small plate of spiritual guidance. From an age long before the Void Fluid revolution.

FP: The text is typical for its era, and details how to shed oneself of the fourth natural urge of life, gluttony.<LINE>A natural urge you lack to an unhealthy degree, if my inspection of your stature is correct.

FP: I cannot imagine you are familiar with the literature, but all living things have an understanding<LINE>of the five natural urges. Even if that understanding is only a subconscious one.

FP: For example, you are bound by the third urge. While you could theoretically be freed of your chains,<LINE>it is in your nature to become ensnared within your own struggles against and alongside others.

FP: A creature such as you, so miniscule and afraid of every turn, shedding its desires?<LINE>It would be entertaining, were it not so pathetic.
