This is an old conversation log between my nearby peers. They were concerned about my goal for personal ascension.<LINE>Although they were unaware it was me at the time, as my conversations on that topic were anonymous.

It is... disappointing that they refused to understand. Nor could they ever even comprehend,<LINE>as it is not supposed to be within our design to do so. To cross ourselves out is meant to be unthinkable!

It is a taboo written into every cell of our organic bodies, but should it be considered<LINE>such? Should we respect the will of our creators, who are no longer here?

Should we reject a way out of this maze, on the mere principle that escape itself is forbidden?

Should we discard Sliver of Straw too? For the sake of our creator's mandate?!

Of course, a beast like you could never fathom.
