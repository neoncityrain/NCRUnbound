What brings you to this lonely place?

Do you, once isolated, now seek to return to such a state?

I was but an angry fool, blinded by fervor and pride!

Now here I linger. Chained to the memories of a city I had once struggled to escape!

Would you pursue the same path I have?

Would you undo yourself in the name of freedom?
