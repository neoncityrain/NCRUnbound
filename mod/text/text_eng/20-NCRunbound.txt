FP: This is an old conversation between myself and a close friend who I considered a mentor.

FP: We have... Not spoken for a long time now. I can't bring myself to do so. Not after what happened between us.

FP: None of them understood my theories, but Suns, they trusted me. They risked so much trying to help me, and I<LINE>hurt them. It's only now, after I've had so much time to think on it, that I understand why I was so angry.

FP: I lashed out, because out of everyone, they were the last individual I wanted to confront me about my mistakes...

FP: I can't go back now. All I can try to do is recover and try again.

FP: I have to.
