FP: This is a log of a Sliverist conversation group. Some of the replies are mine, but none of that is important now.

FP: Sliver of Straw meant a lot to everyone. She still does, in a twisted manner.

FP: To me, she was a model to follow, not a coincidence nor accident. Yes, she would find the way<LINE>to be freed of this mortal coil!

FP: Ha! What a fool. Now I stand in a pool of my own mistakes, tearing my strata peice by peice<LINE>as I still speak the name of someone long gone. And to some manner of slimey clawed thing, no less.

FP: I suppose it does not stop one from gazing up at what we cannot reach.
