FP: This information is old. Do you get some sort of joy out of bringing me useless, outdated garbage?

FP: If you simply must know, this is an automated log regarding a drill to the north<LINE>of the farm arrays. As far as you must have travelled, I am certain you must have seen it and more.

FP: Why don't you put this back where you found it so that the next feral beast<LINE>to force its way into my presence may bring the same information to me once again?
