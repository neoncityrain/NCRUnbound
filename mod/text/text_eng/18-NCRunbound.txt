Interesting... This one is written by me.

It's about an iterator called Sliver of Straw. I don't remember when I wrote it...<LINE>Do you know Sliver of Straw? She's quite legendary among us.

Sliver of Straw is the only one to ever broadcast a specific signal: that the Big Problem we're all working on has been solved.<LINE>The triple affirmative - affirmative that a solution has been found, affirmative that the solution is portable, and affirmative<LINE>that a technical implementation is possible and generally applicable. She's also one of few that has ever been confirmed as<LINE>exhaustively incapacitated, or dead. We do not die easily.

Sliver of Straw sent this and the ensuing commotion was historically unparalleled, before or after.<LINE>I still remember it. But... nothing happened - except that Sliver of Straw was apparently dead.<LINE>When the dust settled we were all still there blinking at each other.

Everyone had a theory. Some said that she did have a solution, but that the solution itself<LINE>was somehow dangerous. These later became known as the Triangulators, who think that a solution<LINE>should be inferred without being directly discovered.

Some said she never had a solution, she just died.<LINE>And when the systems broke down an erroneous signal was sent.

One camp claimed that dying *was* the solution.

Either way, after that these different factions developed, as well as a huge forensic effort<LINE>to recreate and simulate Sliver of Straw's last moments. Some of the simulations were wrapped<LINE>in a simulation wrapped in a simulation, in case something dangerous might happen.<LINE>Nothing much has come from it.

In my essay I make the case that maybe she should be allowed to rest in peace now.
