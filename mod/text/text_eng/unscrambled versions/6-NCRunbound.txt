A grand design in beast's clothes!

Have you come to meet the end you've lusted over?

Come, come, feed the void! It wishes to embrace you at long last.

Your struggle will end, and your journey will become nothing more than a faded memory.

You, just as all others, will disappear into naught but a silent construct.

Isn't that wonderful?
