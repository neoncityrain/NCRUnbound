Strange...

Something still draws me here. Even after all this time.

The weather is so different now, but the fields...

I do not need eyes to know that the grasses still sway gently in the winds.

To have grasped at the boundless infinites of the cosmic void...

Yet here I am contemplating these same fields as I once did.

I imagine you are doing the same, are you not?

After all, you were once among us, and despite everything, you are now here.

Despite everything, you are now here, contemplating the same fields as I!
