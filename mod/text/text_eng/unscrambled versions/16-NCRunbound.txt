BSM: This one... is authored by Five Pebbles, when he was young. There has been an attempt to<LINE>scramble the data, but it's sloppily done, and most is still somewhat legible.

BSM: It's written in internal language, or thoughts, so it is hard for me to translate so you would understand. It's a methodology for<LINE>global ascension of course - quite good, although the Peripherists or the Slab Mongers certainly wouldn't agree!

BSM: "...considering the eight and the twenty sixth amendments to the Capricious Dogma, we are apparently supposed to take<LINE>for granted that a meaning collector point inversion is the only way to approach what has later become referred to<LINE>as 'noise milking' (or occasionally 'rock swatting'). I will argue my disagreement with this, not in regards to kind<LINE>but in regards to..." Could it say... "volume"? Actually, are you getting anything out of this?

BSM: I suppose you found this in his waste department? I would be wary of going there - on his first fit<LINE>of corruption he dumped a lot of infected material there, and if it has survived it could easily eat<LINE>a little creature like you. Not that it would be as dangerous as going into Pebbles himself...

BSM: Also the pearls in the waste masses inevitably attract scavengers, which can be very dangerous when provoked.

BSM: But, you seem to have made it out of there.
