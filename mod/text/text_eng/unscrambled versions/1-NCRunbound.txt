It has been a long time since I have seen one of your kind.

Do you, too, remember when the world was in its true state?

Do you remember when the sun would rise, the streets would buzz, the rain would bring about no end?

I miss those times, yet it may be that trapping me.

And what of you, in new flesh?

Do not be surprised; you can no less hide your nature than I may move on.
