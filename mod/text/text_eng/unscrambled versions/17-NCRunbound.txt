BSM: It's about the local aquifer - it must be quite old, from when Five Pebbles was in the planning phase.

BSM: Water is the most important resource for our basic function. Most of our processing is outsourced to<LINE>microbe strata which need a flow of clean water or else slag builds up, our processes seize, and<LINE>eventually we die. It is... very painful. They used to say that an iterator drinks a river, but neither<LINE>of us two have seen a natural river so I suppose the analogy is lost on us, <PlayerName>!

BSM: Originally water supply was very important when placing iterators. Later there would be a great equalizer - the fact that we breathe out as much<LINE>vapor as we inhale water led to there being water available everywhere, and the latest few generations could be placed almost completely freely.

BSM: Building Pebbles so close to me was believed to be a risky choice, but the groundwater was<LINE>finally deemed as sufficient. It was not a good decision, in hindsight.
