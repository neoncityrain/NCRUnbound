FP: You took this from within the city? These are architectural notes from the original construction of my facility.

FP: The notes entail plans for bridges that connect two of my legs to those of my neighbor's, Looks to the Moon.<LINE>This particular configuration between two iterators is quite unique, and very peculiar. It is a rare<LINE>occurrence for two iterators to be located this close to each other.

FP: During the time period of these plans, solutions were being drafted to allow for a mass migration of<LINE>citizens out of Moon's city. With how inhospitable the surface had become, attempting to escort an<LINE>entire city's populace across the ground over any length of distance would have been disastrous.

FP: These connecting bridges served as a high-altitude evacuation route that could facilitate safe transit from her city to mine.

FP: I cannot help but wonder if such bridges still even stand.
