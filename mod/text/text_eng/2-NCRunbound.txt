Once again, you return, yet it would be a lie to say we have waited for you.

No offense is intended, of course. It is simply the truth.

How does it feel? You look upon our kingdom, rusting away...

Still, you are here.

It was never meant to be a curse, but rather, a gift.

Do you see? Or will you trap yourself in an eternal memory, just as ones such as I have?
