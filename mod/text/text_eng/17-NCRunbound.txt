This is very old. These are the blueprints for the local aquifer that facilitated<LINE>my initial construction next to my neighbor, Looks to the Moon.

She was built adjacent to a large canyon that was rich in resources. But continual operation of her facility<LINE>lowered the waterbed to such an extent that the area began to wither away into an infertile state.

Continual cycles of rain from our operation forces the water into smaller localized pockets around the nearby terrain.<LINE>The aquifer was meant to consolidate these distributed water systems and funnel their contents back into the canyon.

This would be a lengthy process, however. Small on the time scale of us iterators, but disastrous<LINE>on the time scale of our creators, who Moon no longer had the capabilities to provide for.

Many solutions were discussed, but ultimately my construction was the one settled upon. To provide a haven<LINE>to the impoverished, and to remove burden from Moon, to give her the time she needed to fully recover.

...How ironic then, how things have turned out.
