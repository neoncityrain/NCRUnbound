This is... where did you find this?

This pearl contains a virus targeted toward iterators. Part of the pearl has been burned away,<LINE>suggesting it has not only been read already, but has met its mark.

On first glance, it appears to be a simple ciphered letter from someone with the tag "KTB."

Looking closer, scanning through the words and attempting to decipher them is meant to trip<LINE>certain vital lines of code - essentially leading to an effect not unlike hibernation.

This is nothing but a sleep, however. It is not a method for crossing oneself out.

The translated words on this pearl go on to apologize, expressing regret for not doing more...

I hope you haven't given this to any other iterators, <PlayerName>.
