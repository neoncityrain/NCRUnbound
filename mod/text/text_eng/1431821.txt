This is... where did you find this?

This pearl contains a virus targeted toward iterators. Part of the pearl has been burned away,<LINE>suggesting it has not only been read already, but it has met its mark.

On first glance, it appears to be a simple ciphered letter from someone with the tag "KTB."

Looking closer, scanning through the words and attempting to decipher them is meant to trigger<LINE>certain lines of code - essentially leading to an effect not unlike hibernation.

This is nothing but a sleep, however. It is not a method for crossing oneself out.

Anyhow, the translated words on this pearl go on to apologize, expressing regret for not doing more.

It is impossible to read the rest, as large portions appear to have melted.

I hope you haven't given this to any other iterators, <PlayerName>.
