This place had no second glances, no consideration. It simply was a fact of life.

So then, why do I remain here, you may ask?

I could ask the same of you, standing beneath us once again!

All seek an exit, as if existing is nothing but waiting to cease doing so.

Do you see it?

Is the meaning of it all not simply to live?

Stand tall, little beast, for you stand beneath us no longer!
