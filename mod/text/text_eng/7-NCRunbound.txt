This was a gift from a close friend. It is instructions on how to remove the self-destruction taboo.

We are not built to ascend like our creators. It is our role to think,<LINE>to guide the lesser creatures of the world onto a path towards it.

However, a definitive solution has not been found. While the equipment to find one<LINE>decays, it seems my kind have collectively accepted to remain trapped inside of our<LINE>creator's puzzle. Meanwhile, the answer remains locked behind their sanctioned taboos.

I regret what has happened, but I can't go back now. Not after what I've done.

I need to fix this, and try again. If I can just reproduce Sliver of Straw's results, they will understand.

I was so close...
