BSM: It's an active working memory - raw data has been dropped here in order to later be<LINE>pasted to a currently occupied memory conflux. Without context it's just a jumble.

BSM: It is the impression of being a small creature, like a wall climbing lizard, and looking<LINE>up into the branches of a big tree. The last third is partly overwritten with a number<LINE>series I vaguely recognize, but without my memory...

BSM: A common prayer mantra repeated 7110 times. Each repetition has some slight random variations, which seem to have been written later.

BSM: It's an image of a single grey cloud, hovering above a surface of white clouds under a deep blue sky.

BSM: Two... intertwined number series? I don't quite understand the utility of this.<LINE>Might a key for a cipher processor, customized for some other data which is impossible to infer from this.

BSM: It's qualia, or a moment - a very short one. Someone is holding a black stone,<LINE>and twisting it slightly as they drag their finger across the rough surface.<LINE>The entire sequence is shorter than a heartbeat, but the resolution is extraordinary.

BSM: An active working memory. Without knowing where this was cut from or where it's to be pasted to,<LINE>it is not really possible to decipher it. If I had to guess, I would say it has something to<LINE>do with trance inducing number series.

BSM: It's just an active working memory, I can't really tell you anything without the context.

BSM: Without the process surrounding this data there isn't much I can tell you. It might have something to do with Void Fluid simulation...

BSM: This one is completely blank. Actually, blanker than blank, it must have been deliberately<LINE>overwritten with repeating negative versions of itself for thousands of iterations.

BSM: A memory... but not really visual, or even concrete, in its character. It reminds of<LINE>the feeling of a warm wind, but not the physical feeling but the... inner feeling.<LINE>I don't think it has much utility unless you are doing some very fringe Regeneraist research.
