This is an old broadcast node's read-only data. It is decayed beyond repair.

There is nothing to read, this pearl has decayed beyond use.

This is an old decayed broadcast log. There is nothing left except for dates and names present for the conversation.

This is the read-only data from a broadcasting relay. It requires an overseer's intervention to enter long term storage.<LINE>Otherwise they decay like this one has. The header says it was addressed to my nearest neighbor, Looks to the Moon...

This is an equipment manifest from the surface. None of us care about these all that much.

This is the remains of a broadcast node. The conversation on it is a private matter however, so I'm not going to read it for you.

This data was encrypted and sent over the broadcasting network while it was still functional. Without the cipher it is unreadable.

It is a collection of overseer images. Before the network decayed, we would occasionally share interesting scenes<LINE>our overseers had encountered on the surface. A way to pass the time while waiting for slow processes to finish.

This is the remains of a broadcasting relay. The data is decayed, but it reminds me of better times...

This appears to be someone's final broadcast before being disconnected from the local group. It is too decayed to read beyond the<LINE>first few lines. The header is damaged too. It's a mystery who sent this. The network has been decaying for a long time now.

"Transcendental Inversion! Transcendental Inversion!" I'm not going to read the rest of this fool's ramblings. This is an old<LINE>conversation from the local broadcasting group, before the network fell too far into decay to use over long distances.
