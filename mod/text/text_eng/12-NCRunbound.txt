FP: This is a production log from a facility on the surface. It has been a very long time since I've cared about<LINE>reading one, but the name... roughly translates as Side House. I remember the shipments of holy ash I used to receive from there.

FP: I don't know how I would gain access to holy ash in the present day, not that I have much use for it. Despite all<LINE>the independent power of my machinery, the relationship I had with my creators was a mutually symbiotic one.

FP: I was built to provide for them, but there was also much I relied on them to provide to me.

FP: Their absence has made things harder. I suppose the only gifts I receive now are pearls and such from your kind.

FP: I certainly found more use in the ashes.
